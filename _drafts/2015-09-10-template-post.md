Change date and title above, insert post below, and remove the cheatsheet link and this text.
Title should be something relevant to the article.  Rename your post(this file) with the current date and then journal abbreviation, the first author, and the year published for the article you are reviewing, add a number at the end if needed to make it unique.  Example: 2015-09-10-isme-stevens-2014.md or 2015-09-10-isme-stevens-2014-2.md (for a second article published by stevens in isme in 2014)
